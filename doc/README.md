# Documentation

This documentation will guide you in accessing the models and submitting your own contributions.


## Downloading the Assets

Downloading the assets from Github is described in our [usage guide](usage.md).


## Submitting Assets

If you want to work on a replacement asset and/or submit your own contributions, have a look at our [submission guide](submitting.md).

Take a look at our [ID list](id_reference/game_tags.md) to see which models still need to be made and which are already done.
